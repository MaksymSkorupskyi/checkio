"""The Most Frequent Weekdays
Whatâ€™s your favourite day of the week? Check if it's the most common day of the week in a year.

You are given a year as an integer (e. g. 2001).
You should return the most frequent day(s) of the week in that particular year.
The result has to be a list of days sorted by the order of days in a week (e. g. ['Monday', 'Tuesday']).
Week starts with Monday.

Input: Year as an int.
Output: The list of most common days sorted by the order of days in a week (from Monday to Sunday).

Example:
most_frequent_days(1084) == ['Tuesday', 'Wednesday']
most_frequent_days(1167) == ['Sunday']

Preconditions: Year is between 1 and 9999. Week starts with Monday.
